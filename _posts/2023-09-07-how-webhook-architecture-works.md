## How the webhook architecture works:

WebSocket is a protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It allows real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers, making it suitable for applications that require constant updates or notifications.

1. **Setting Up a Webhook**:
   The client (receiver) provides a URL endpoint to the server (sender) that will be used to receive webhook notifications. This URL is typically exposed by the client and can be thought of as a callback URL.

2. **Event Triggering**:
   The server generates or identifies an event that requires notifying the client. This event could be anything of significance, such as a new order being placed, a user signing up, or a data update.

3. **Sending Webhook Notification**:
   When the event occurs, the server sends an HTTP POST request to the URL endpoint provided by the client. This request contains relevant data related to the event, often in a structured format like JSON or XML.

4. **Client Processing**:
   The client receives the webhook notification at the provided endpoint. It processes the incoming data and performs any required actions based on the event. This could include updating its own database, triggering further processes, sending notifications, or other custom logic.

Webhooks are commonly used for various purposes, including:

- **Real-time Data Synchronization**: Webhooks are useful for keeping data in sync between different systems without the need for constant polling by the client.

- **Event Notification**: Webhooks can be used to notify clients of important events, such as a payment confirmation, a new comment on a post, or a user login.

- **Automation and Integration**: Webhooks allow different services to integrate seamlessly by triggering actions in response to events in other services.

- **Custom Workflows**: Clients can define custom workflows based on incoming webhook data, enabling them to create complex automation scenarios.

Webhooks provide a way for systems to communicate in a decentralized and event-driven manner, allowing for real-time interactions and reducing the need for continuous client polling. However, it's important to consider security, error handling, and reliability when implementing webhooks to ensure that the communication is secure and the system can gracefully handle any issues that may arise during the process.
