# 8 Thotaakkal(Bullets) of API Architectures in 2023

## 1. REST (Representational State Transfer)

REST is a widely used architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and emphasizes stateless communication. Resources are represented as URLs, and the API uses these URLs to interact with the resources. REST APIs are simple and scalable, making them popular for web applications.

## 2. Webhooks

Webhooks are a design pattern used in API architecture to enable real-time communication and data synchronization between different systems or services. Unlike traditional APIs where a client makes requests to a server to retrieve or send data, with webhooks, the server initiates communication by sending data to a predefined endpoint (URL) on the client's side when a specific event occurs. This allows the client to react and process the data in real-time. [Read more...](/how-webhook-architecture-works)

## 3. GraphQL

GraphQL is an alternative to REST that provides more flexibility in data retrieval. Instead of multiple endpoints, GraphQL APIs have a single endpoint that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. This helps reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data, making APIs more efficient and improving client experience. [Read more...](/graphql-in-api-architecture)

## 4. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It uses XML for message formatting and relies on other protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, and more for message negotiation. SOAP APIs tend to be more rigid and complex compared to REST or GraphQL.

## 5. WebSockets

WebSocket is a protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It allows real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers, making it suitable for applications that require constant updates or notifications.

## 6. gRPC (Remote Procedure Call)

RPC APIs allow programs to execute functions or procedures on a remote server as if they were local. Examples include gRPC and XML-RPC. gRPC, for instance, uses protocol buffers for data serialization and HTTP/2 for transport, making it efficient and suitable for high-performance applications. And JSON-RPC, which uses JSON. [Read more...](/api-architecture-of-grpc)

## 7. MQTT (Message Queing Telemetry Transport)

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed for efficient communication between devices and systems, particularly in scenarios with low bandwidth, high latency, or unreliable networks. While MQTT is not a traditional API architecture style, it is often used as a communication protocol in various IoT (Internet of Things) and real-time messaging architectures. [Read More...](/mqtt-api-architecture)

## 8. AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)

AMQP is a messaging protocol that is commonly used for building robust and scalable communication systems, especially in scenarios where reliable and asynchronous messaging between different components or services is crucial. While not a traditional API architecture style like REST or GraphQL, AMQP is an important communication protocol used within various architectural patterns.[Read More...](/overview-amqp-api-architecture)
