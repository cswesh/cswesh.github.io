# 8 Thotaakkal(Bullets) of API Architectures in 2023

## 1. REST (Representational State Transfer)

REST is a widely used architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and emphasizes stateless communication. Resources are represented as URLs, and the API uses these URLs to interact with the resources. REST APIs are simple and scalable, making them popular for web applications.

## 2. Webhooks

Webhooks are a design pattern used in API architecture to enable real-time communication and data synchronization between different systems or services. Unlike traditional APIs where a client makes requests to a server to retrieve or send data, with webhooks, the server initiates communication by sending data to a predefined endpoint (URL) on the client's side when a specific event occurs. This allows the client to react and process the data in real-time. [Read more...](#how-the-webhook-architecture-works)

## 3. GraphQL

GraphQL is an alternative to REST that provides more flexibility in data retrieval. Instead of multiple endpoints, GraphQL APIs have a single endpoint that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. This helps reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data, making APIs more efficient and improving client experience. [Read more...](#graphql-in-api-architecture)

## 4. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It uses XML for message formatting and relies on other protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, and more for message negotiation. SOAP APIs tend to be more rigid and complex compared to REST or GraphQL.

## 5. WebSockets

WebSocket is a protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It allows real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers, making it suitable for applications that require constant updates or notifications.

## 6. gRPC (Remote Procedure Call)

RPC APIs allow programs to execute functions or procedures on a remote server as if they were local. Examples include gRPC and XML-RPC. gRPC, for instance, uses protocol buffers for data serialization and HTTP/2 for transport, making it efficient and suitable for high-performance applications. And JSON-RPC, which uses JSON. [Read more...](#api-architecture-of-grpc)

## 7. MQTT (Message Queing Telemetry Transport)

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed for efficient communication between devices and systems, particularly in scenarios with low bandwidth, high latency, or unreliable networks. While MQTT is not a traditional API architecture style, it is often used as a communication protocol in various IoT (Internet of Things) and real-time messaging architectures.

## 8. AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)

AMQP is a messaging protocol that is commonly used for building robust and scalable communication systems, especially in scenarios where reliable and asynchronous messaging between different components or services is crucial. While not a traditional API architecture style like REST or GraphQL, AMQP is an important communication protocol used within various architectural patterns.[Read More...](#an-overview-of-amqp-api-architecture)

## GraphQL in API architecture:

1. **Flexible Queries**:
   With GraphQL, clients can request only the specific fields and data they need, avoiding the over-fetching problem commonly seen in REST APIs. This ability to customize queries is particularly valuable in scenarios where bandwidth is limited or where optimizing data transfer is important.

2. **Single Endpoint**:
   Unlike REST APIs, which often have multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL APIs typically have a single endpoint for all interactions. This reduces the need to maintain a large number of endpoints and simplifies the API structure.

3. **Strongly Typed Schema**:
   GraphQL APIs are defined using a schema that specifies the types of data that can be queried, along with their relationships and available operations. The schema serves as a contract between the client and server.

4. **Introspection and Documentation**:
   GraphQL schemas can be introspected, meaning clients can query the schema itself to discover available types, fields, and operations. This feature makes it easy to generate interactive documentation for the API.

5. **Real-time and Batch Queries**:
   GraphQL supports real-time updates using subscriptions, allowing clients to receive updates when specific data changes. It also enables batched queries, reducing the number of round-trips between the client and server.

6. **Complex Data Fetching**:
   GraphQL can efficiently handle complex data fetching scenarios, aggregating data from multiple sources or databases into a single response.

7. **Client Control**:
   GraphQL shifts control over data fetching from the server to the client. This empowers front-end developers to request exactly the data they need for their views, reducing the need for back-end changes when UI requirements evolve.

GraphQL is often used within various architectural styles and scenarios:

- **Microservices**: GraphQL can aggregate data from multiple microservices into a single response, reducing the need for multiple API calls.

- **Single-Page Applications**: GraphQL is well-suited for powering dynamic and interactive single-page applications (SPAs) where optimizing data transfer is important.

- **Mobile Applications**: GraphQL's flexibility is valuable in mobile app development, where data consumption and performance are critical.

- **Custom Workflows**: GraphQL's ability to define custom queries makes it suitable for scenarios where clients need to perform complex, ad hoc data queries.

Overall, GraphQL offers a powerful and efficient way to design APIs that provide flexibility, reduce data transfer overhead, and enable interactive and dynamic client-server communication. It's important to note that GraphQL is not a replacement for REST but rather an alternative approach to building APIs with its own strengths and considerations.


## Key aspects of SOAP in API architecture:

1. **Message Format**:
   SOAP messages are XML-based and follow a standardized format. They consist of an envelope that encapsulates the message content, headers for additional information, and a body that contains the actual data.

2. **Protocol Independence**:
   SOAP is designed to work over different transport protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and more. This makes it versatile and suitable for a wide range of communication scenarios.

3. **Service Definition**:
   A SOAP-based API is defined using a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) document. The WSDL describes the available operations, input and output parameters, and the structure of the SOAP messages.

4. **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**:
   SOAP allows clients to invoke remote procedures or methods exposed by a server. Clients send SOAP messages with requests, and servers respond with SOAP messages containing the results.

5. **Security and Reliability Features**:
   SOAP provides various security mechanisms, including encryption and authentication, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the messages. It also offers built-in error handling and reliability features.

6. **Interoperability and Standards**:
   SOAP was designed with a focus on interoperability, allowing software components written in different programming languages and running on different platforms to communicate seamlessly.

SOAP was one of the earliest protocols used for web services, and it was widely adopted in the early days of web services development. However, over time, REST and other lightweight protocols gained popularity due to their simplicity and ease of use. SOAP's XML-based nature and complexity have led to some challenges, including larger message sizes and overhead compared to other protocols.

While SOAP is still used in certain enterprise scenarios, many modern API architectures tend to favor simpler and more lightweight protocols like REST or gRPC for building web services and APIs. However, it's important to note that SOAP can still play a role in specific scenarios where features like security, reliability, and strict contract definition are priorities.


## WebSockets in API Architecture

1. **Establishing a Connection**:
   The client initiates a WebSocket connection by sending a WebSocket handshake request to the server. If the server supports WebSockets, it responds with a WebSocket handshake response, and the connection is established.

2. **Full-Duplex Communication**:
   Once the WebSocket connection is established, both the client and server can send and receive messages independently, without waiting for a request-response cycle. This enables real-time data exchange.

3. **Persistent Connection**:
   Unlike traditional HTTP connections, which are short-lived, WebSockets maintain a persistent connection as long as both the client and server want to communicate. This reduces the overhead of establishing new connections for each message.

4. **Low Latency and Overhead**:
   WebSockets have lower latency compared to HTTP because there is no need to repeatedly open and close connections for each message. The protocol has less overhead, making it suitable for real-time applications.

5. **Supported Message Types**:
   WebSockets support sending various types of messages, including text and binary data. Clients and servers can exchange messages in both directions.

WebSockets are often used within different architectural styles and scenarios:

- **Real-Time Applications**: WebSockets are commonly used in real-time applications such as chat applications, online gaming, live notifications, collaborative editing, and financial trading platforms.

- **Event-Driven Architectures**: WebSockets enable real-time event notification and communication between components or microservices in an event-driven architecture.

- **Interactive Web Applications**: Web applications can use WebSockets to provide interactive and dynamic user experiences without the need for frequent page reloads.

- **IoT (Internet of Things)**: WebSockets are suitable for transmitting real-time data from IoT devices to a central server or other devices.

While WebSockets provide benefits for real-time communication, they have some considerations:

- **Infrastructure Support**: Both the client and server need to support WebSockets. Some older networks or proxy configurations might not fully support the protocol.

- **Connection Management**: Maintaining a persistent connection requires resources. Servers need to manage a potentially large number of concurrent connections.

- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and reconnection strategies are important to ensure the stability of WebSocket-based applications.

Overall, WebSockets are a valuable tool for enabling efficient and real-time communication between clients and servers in various architectural scenarios, contributing to dynamic and interactive user experiences.


## Key principles and concepts of REST in API architecture:

1. **Client-Server Architecture**:
   REST separates the client and server components, allowing them to evolve independently. Clients make requests to servers, which process those requests and send back responses.

2. **Statelessness**:
   Each client request to the server must contain all the necessary information for the server to fulfill the request. The server doesn't store any client state between requests, which simplifies scalability and improves reliability.

3. **Cacheability**:
   Responses from the server can be cached on the client side to improve performance. Servers can include caching-related headers in responses to control how clients cache the data.

4. **Uniform Interface**:
   REST APIs have a uniform and consistent interface that is made up of four key constraints:
   - **Resource Identification**: Resources are uniquely identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
   - **Resource Manipulation through Representations**: Clients interact with resources using representations (such as JSON or XML). These representations contain the data and state of the resource.
   - **Self-Descriptive Messages**: Each message (request or response) includes enough information for the recipient to understand how to process it.
   - **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**: Responses from the server include links to related resources, guiding clients on how to navigate the API.

5. **Layered System**:
   REST allows for the use of intermediaries, such as proxy servers, load balancers, and gateways, between clients and servers. These intermediaries can provide additional features without affecting the overall system architecture.

6. **Code on Demand (optional)**:
   Servers can optionally provide executable code (such as JavaScript) to clients. This constraint is rarely used in practice.

RESTful APIs are typically implemented using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and resources represented as URLs. Clients use these methods to perform operations on resources, and servers respond with appropriate status codes and data representations.

It's important to note that while REST provides a set of architectural principles and constraints, the term "RESTful" is often used more loosely to describe APIs that follow these principles to varying degrees. Many APIs claim to be RESTful but might not strictly adhere to all the constraints.

Overall, REST has become a foundational architectural style for building APIs due to its simplicity, scalability, and wide adoption across various domains.


## How the webhook architecture works:

1. **Setting Up a Webhook**:
   The client (receiver) provides a URL endpoint to the server (sender) that will be used to receive webhook notifications. This URL is typically exposed by the client and can be thought of as a callback URL.

2. **Event Triggering**:
   The server generates or identifies an event that requires notifying the client. This event could be anything of significance, such as a new order being placed, a user signing up, or a data update.

3. **Sending Webhook Notification**:
   When the event occurs, the server sends an HTTP POST request to the URL endpoint provided by the client. This request contains relevant data related to the event, often in a structured format like JSON or XML.

4. **Client Processing**:
   The client receives the webhook notification at the provided endpoint. It processes the incoming data and performs any required actions based on the event. This could include updating its own database, triggering further processes, sending notifications, or other custom logic.

Webhooks are commonly used for various purposes, including:

- **Real-time Data Synchronization**: Webhooks are useful for keeping data in sync between different systems without the need for constant polling by the client.

- **Event Notification**: Webhooks can be used to notify clients of important events, such as a payment confirmation, a new comment on a post, or a user login.

- **Automation and Integration**: Webhooks allow different services to integrate seamlessly by triggering actions in response to events in other services.

- **Custom Workflows**: Clients can define custom workflows based on incoming webhook data, enabling them to create complex automation scenarios.

Webhooks provide a way for systems to communicate in a decentralized and event-driven manner, allowing for real-time interactions and reducing the need for continuous client polling. However, it's important to consider security, error handling, and reliability when implementing webhooks to ensure that the communication is secure and the system can gracefully handle any issues that may arise during the process.

## API architecture of gRPC:

1. **Remote Procedure Calls**:
   gRPC enables remote procedure calls (RPC) between different components or services, allowing them to invoke methods and exchange data as if they were local function calls. This simplifies the way applications communicate across network boundaries.

2. **Protocol Buffers**:
   gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as the default interface definition language to define the service contract and message structures. Protocol Buffers provide a compact, efficient, and language-independent way to serialize structured data.

3. **HTTP/2 Protocol**:
   gRPC uses HTTP/2 as the underlying transport protocol. This enables features like multiplexing, header compression, and bidirectional streaming, resulting in reduced latency and improved efficiency compared to traditional HTTP/1.x APIs.

4. **Supported Language Bindings**:
   gRPC provides official language bindings for a wide range of programming languages, including but not limited to C++, Java, Python, Go, Ruby, C#, and JavaScript.

5. **Code Generation**:
   gRPC generates client and server code from the service definition written in Protocol Buffers. This code generation simplifies the development process by handling many low-level details of communication.

6. **Streaming Support**:
   gRPC supports both unary RPC (request-response) and streaming RPC, including server streaming (client sends a single request, server responds with a stream) and bidirectional streaming (both client and server exchange streams of messages).

7. **Error Handling and Metadata**:
   gRPC provides a standardized way to handle errors and attach metadata to requests and responses, making it easier to include additional context and information.

8. **Security and Authentication**:
   gRPC supports various authentication and security mechanisms, including TLS/SSL encryption and authentication using tokens, certificates, or other methods.

gRPC is often used in various architectural styles, such as microservices, where services need to communicate efficiently and asynchronously. It can also be used in event-driven architectures and scenarios where real-time communication and efficient data exchange are important.

Overall, gRPC is a powerful technology that provides a modern and efficient way to design and implement APIs for distributed systems, making it a popular choice for building high-performance and scalable applications.

## Here's how MQTT works within an API architecture

1. **Publisher**:
   A device or application acting as a publisher generates data or events and publishes them to specific MQTT topics. Topics serve as channels through which data is distributed.

2. **Broker**:
   The MQTT broker is a central messaging server that manages the communication between publishers and subscribers. It receives published messages and routes them to the appropriate subscribers based on their topic subscriptions. The broker is responsible for maintaining the message queues and ensuring reliable delivery.

3. **Subscriber**:
   Subscribers are devices or applications that are interested in receiving messages related to specific topics. They subscribe to topics on the MQTT broker, and the broker forwards published messages to all relevant subscribers.

4. **Message Delivery**:
   Messages published by a publisher are delivered to all subscribers that have subscribed to the corresponding topic. Subscribers can process the received messages as needed, which might involve updating data, triggering actions, or sending notifications.

Key features of MQTT include:

- **Quality of Service (QoS) Levels**: MQTT offers different levels of message delivery assurance, ranging from "at most once" (fire and forget) to "at least once" (guaranteed delivery) and "exactly once" (guaranteed once-only delivery).

- **Retained Messages**: Publishers can send retained messages to specific topics, ensuring that new subscribers receive the most recent message published on that topic immediately upon subscription.

- **Last Will and Testament (LWT)**: Clients can set a "last will" message that the broker will publish if the client unexpectedly disconnects, helping other clients detect the client's status.

- **Low Overhead**: MQTT is designed to be lightweight, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices and networks with limited bandwidth.

While MQTT itself is not an API architecture style, it can be used in conjunction with other architectural styles, such as microservices or event-driven architecture, to facilitate real-time communication and data exchange between components or devices. It's particularly well-suited for scenarios involving IoT devices, sensors, and applications that require efficient and reliable messaging over constrained networks.

## An overview of AMQP API architecture:

**Message Broker:**
In an AMQP-based architecture, there is a message broker that acts as an intermediary between message producers (senders) and consumers (receivers). The broker manages the routing, delivery, and persistence of messages.

**Exchanges and Queues:**
AMQP introduces the concepts of exchanges and queues. An exchange receives messages from producers and routes them to queues based on predefined routing rules. Queues hold the messages until they are consumed by subscribers.

**Publish-Subscribe Model:**
AMQP supports a publish-subscribe model where messages can be published to exchanges, and multiple queues can subscribe to those exchanges. This allows for broadcasting messages to multiple consumers.

**Message Acknowledgment:**
AMQP provides mechanisms for message acknowledgment, ensuring that a message is only considered delivered and removed from the queue after the consumer acknowledges its successful processing.

**Quality of Service (QoS):**
AMQP offers different levels of QoS to control the reliability of message delivery, including "at most once," "at least once," and "exactly once" delivery semantics.

**Message Routing and Transformation:**
AMQP supports various routing patterns and message transformations, allowing for flexible and dynamic message handling based on the application's needs.

**Integration with Architectural Styles:**
AMQP can be integrated into different architectural styles, such as microservices, event-driven architecture, and message-driven systems. It enables components to communicate asynchronously and decoupled from each other.

AMQP is used to build systems that require reliable and asynchronous messaging, including scenarios like financial transactions, real-time data processing, IoT data streams, and more. It's worth noting that AMQP is not a replacement for APIs but rather a complementary technology that helps facilitate communication and data exchange between different parts of a distributed system.

RabbitMQ is one of the most popular message brokers that implements the AMQP protocol. However, there may be other developments or advancements in this area since then.
